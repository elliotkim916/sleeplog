# **Sleep Logger**

An application that keeps track of how much you slept and how your sleep was.  Users can fill out how many hours they slept, 
answer a simple multiple choice question regarding how they felt when they woke up, and add any additional details about how their 
sleep was.  

## **Motivation**
I believe sleep is very important to one's health and I felt like I wasn't getting enough of it.  Therefore, I wanted to create an 
application that informed me based on my age how much sleep I should be getting day to day, keep track of the number of hours I slept, 
& note how my sleep was so that I can accurately see the quality of my sleep & how much sleep I should be getting.
